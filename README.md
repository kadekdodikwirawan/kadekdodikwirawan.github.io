## 🚀 Getting Started

Since this is a static site, you don't need `npm` or a build process to run it.

### Option 1: VS Code Live Server (Recommended)

1. Open the project folder in **VS Code**.
2. Install the **Live Server** extension.
3. Right-click `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.

### Option 2: Python Simple HTTP Server

If you have Python installed, you can serve the site globally on your machine:

```bash
# Run inside the project directory
python -m http.server 5500

```

Then visit: `http://localhost:5500`

### Option 3: Direct File Open

Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser (note: some features like history API or strict CORS policies might behave differently than a real server).

## 🌍 Deployment

This site is configured for **GitHub Pages**.

1. Push your changes to the `main` or `master` branch.
2. Go to **Settings > Pages** in your GitHub repository.
3. Ensure the source is set to your default branch.
